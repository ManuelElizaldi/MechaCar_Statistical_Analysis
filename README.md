# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of the project
In this project we did a business analysis of a new MechaCar Prototype that is having production troubles and that's affecting the company's manufacturing teamâ€™s progress. In order to perform the analysis we used the production data to determine the best decision to solve this problem. These datasets can be find in the RStudio folder.

### Analysis Overview

In this analysis we include the following:

- Linear regression to determine the variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
- Summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- T-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
